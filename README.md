### *Presentation included*

This project simulates the evolution of a planetary system over time using one of seven different numerical methods, with a focus on evaluating them by their speed and accuracy. The implementation of the model is generalised, and it is capable of representing most any system of planetary bodies.

All user-specified parameters can be found at the bottom of `main.py`; change those to adjust the simulation's behavior/initial conditions. The only required packages are `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
